GET 'www.here.com/users/2' is a restful api for accesing a database of users, which should be a link given to the client browser through a GET 'www.here.com'.\nTLDR: webpage is a representation of state, with links to desired resources/statechange represented in simple http methods and adresses","know":"10"},"3":{"question":"Explain prototypes in JavaScript.","answer":"every object has a prototype reference. When object.method() is called it, if its not found on object it will be looked for on object.prototype then object.prototype.prototype and so on. Prototype is an object itself, so while it performs a similar purpose to a parent class in classical inheritence, its very different.\njs classes are build from constructors that set up a 'this' (i.e function that(a){this.a=a}), and when called like 'new that()' the new keyword sets the prototype of a new object to that.prototype and sets this objects properties using the constructor","know":"10"},"4":{"question":"List the key benefits that HTML5 introduced.","answer":"1)new semantic tags\n2)new video and audio support\n3)canvas\n4)contenteditable='true'\n5)'required' attribute\n6)autofocus\n7)placeholder\n8)accessibility","know":"10"},"5":{"question":"How do media queries work ?","answer":"you create a new scope in css based on properties like @media (min-width: 600px), which will select any time width is a minimum of 600px.

How are they used?","answer":"a closure is when a function retains access to the scope it was defined in alongside the scope its invoked.

If the first path reaches a dead end, go backwards and start over from the last to-visit child thats not already visited.","know":"8"},"9":{"question":"What happens when you type in www.google.com and hit enter?","answer":"your browser attempts to open a socket to www.google.com on port 80. First a DNS lookup is done:\n1) First the browser checks a series of caches, which 'google.com' will probably be in. If the ip adress isnt there you query a DNS resolver with the url, usually your ISP over UDP port 53\n2)DNS resolver starts querying a heirarchy of root servers eventually getting to a .com server which knows a name server which knows the url\n3)After the DNS resolver returns an IP address the browser is able to start opening a connection to the socket hopefully listening on the other end of the ip address and port 80. It starts a TCP/ip handshake\n3a)browser sends a syn (sync) packet,\n3b}upon reciept server sends a ack(acknoledge) and a syn packet\n3c)upon receipt of ack and syn browser sends an ack\n3d)connection is made\n4)once the TCP connection is established the browser will send a HTTP GET request to www.google.com\n5)the server recieves and parses the get request eventually returning a response of some files, atleast one of which is an html file for the browser to display googles homepage and closing its connection\n6)the browser parses the html,the css , and renders a dom. This process involves loading files as needed, so embedding smaller files or non-blocking javascript will improve load time.","know":"7"},"10":{"question":"What's the event loop? How does it work?","answer":"the event loop is a event based model of concurenccy. beside the main call stack is an messageQueue which can be filled with messages with callbacks. when the main call stack is empty ready messages are popped off the queue and their callbacks are added to the call stack. this allows for non-blocking asynchronous operations and makes event based programming simple.","know":"6"},"11":{"question":"asd","answer":"dsa","know":"10"}}}
